### [Supply Chain](./supplychain):
This CorDapp mimics a supply chain transaction, where the deal is incorporated among different teams in the companies on both side of the trade.

### [Worldcup Ticket Booking](./worldcupticketbooking):
This CorDapp demonstrates an ticket booking system with a collaboration of Corda [Accounts](https://training.corda.net/libraries/accounts-lib/) and [Tokens](https://training.corda.net/libraries/tokens-sdk/).
