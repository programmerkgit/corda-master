# observable states cordapp

This CorDapp shows how Corda's [observable states](https://docs.corda.net/docs/corda-os/4.4/tutorial-observer-nodes.html#observer-nodes) feature works. Observable states is the ability for nodes who are not
participants in a transaction to still store them if the transactions are sent to them.


## Concepts

In this CorDapp, we assume that when a seller creates some kind of `HighlyRegulatedState`, they must notify the state
and national regulators. There are two ways to use observable states:

* By piggy-backing on `FinalityFlow`
* By distributing the transaction manually

The two approaches are functionally identical.

In this CorDapp, the seller runs [the `TradeAndReport` flow](./workflows-kotlin/src/main/kotlin/com/observable/flows/TradeAndReport.kt) to create [a new `HighlyRegulatedState`](./contracts-kotlin/src/main/kotlin/com/observable/states/HighlyRegulatedState.kt). Then we can see that the seller will:

* Distribute the state to the buyer and the `state regulator` using `FinalityFlow`
* Distribute the state to the `national regulator` manually using the `ReportManually` flow


## Usage

### Pre-requisites:

See https://docs.corda.net/getting-set-up.html.


### Deploy and run the node
```
./greadlew deployNodes
./build/node/runnodes
```

### Interacting with the nodes:

Go to the [CRaSH](https://docs.corda.net/docs/corda-os/shell.html) shell of Seller, and create a new `HighlyRegulatedState`

    start TradeAndReport buyer: Buyer, stateRegulator: StateRegulator, nationalRegulator: NationalRegulator

The state will be automatically reported to StateRegulator and NationalRegulator, even though they are not
participants. Check this by going to the shell of either node and running:

    run vaultQuery contractStateType: com.observable.states.HighlyRegulatedState

You will see the new `HighlyRegulatedState` in the vault of both nodes.
