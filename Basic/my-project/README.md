# Example CorDapp

Welcome to the example CorDapp. This CorDapp is fully documented [here](http://docs.corda.net/tutorial-cordapp.html).

This example application has modules for both Java and Kotlin and is an exploratory sample for the official [Corda online training](https://training.corda.net). It demonstrates the basic components present in a CorDapp and how they work together using a simple IOU example.
